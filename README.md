# FAKE-CURRENCY-DETECTION-USING-MATLAB
This currency recognition system helps one differentiate the fake currency from the real ones. In order to do it manually one has to measure the size of the paper, remember the pattern of the design and the colour of the currency which would be a very difficult job let alone time consuming.
It is also difficult for people to recognize currencies from different countries.Hence this project provides an effective way to detect fake currency and is also time efficient.This system is based on image processing and makes the process automatic and robust.
